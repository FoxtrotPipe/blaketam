            <p>
                <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
                <div class="content-util--flex flex--content-center">
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--2/3">

                    <p>
                        We started by picking out the small incoveniences in our daily campus life and ask ourselves which of these incoveniences annoy us the most.
                        Eventually, each of us came up with a few ideas and we grouped them into this mindmap.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        At last, we decided to tackle the "toilet issue" in our campus. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4>Problem scope</h4>
                <div class="content-util--flex flex--gap-small">
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2"><img class="content-util--img-showfull" src="assets/problem_scope.png"></div>
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2"><img class="content-util--img-showfull" src="assets/pov.png"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        Some toilets in the campus always have its cubicles preoccupied, while there are still some vacancies in other toilets,  especially in rush hour.  
                        We find out that a lot of UST students find it inconvenient when you go into toilet and find out all cubicles are occupied. 
                        The toilet facilities in campus are therefore not fully utilised. 

                        <br><br>

                        We discover the situation where students are entering and leaving the washroom within a short period. 
                        This happens especially around 12:00, 13:30, 15:00, which are breaks between lectures. 
                        Some lesser-known washrooms are not utilized as frequently as washrooms near hotspots, eg. Library, LT-A, LG1 canteen…
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2 content-util--img-bg" style="background-image: url('assets/toilet_hotspot.png')"></div>
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2 content-util--img-bg" style="background-image: url('assets/toilet_unoccupied.png')"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        All of us are active users of UST’s washroom. We have all experienced the aforementioned toilet-finding problem. 
                        We all agree that different washrooms were not utilized equally, resulting in some crowding while the others having low usage.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4>Our final solution - a smart toilet system</h4>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2"><img class="content-util--img-showfull" src="assets/mindmap_toilet.png"></div>
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2"><img class="content-util--img-showfull" src="assets/toilet_storyboard.png"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        We think that our campus is in urgent need for a smart toilet system. What do we mean by this? 
                        We will design an app that serves to show all available toilet cubicles directly on your mobile phone.
                        This app may be embedded into the existing HKUST Student / Staff app as a plugin too. With this app,
                        student & staff may now be able to know where is the closest washroom with empty slot. 
                        
                        <br><br>

                        On the technical level, The app will have modern, simplistic and intuitive UI so that it is easy to use. 
                        We will also design the app such that the toilet result's latency time is within seconds so that users
                        get to see the result quickly. 
                    </p>

                <h4>My contribution & reflection</h4>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        In my group, I helped to create part of the group presentation ppt by writing ppt text and searching ppt images.
                        I was also responsible for introducing the "Smart Toilet System App" part in our group presentation.

                        <br><br>

                        After this project, I've learnt the importance of thinking from the users' point of view while developing apps.
                        It is always to easy to implement cool and new technologies into an app, but without any consideration and empathy for
                        the app users, the app could become an inconvenience and annoyance regardless of what it could achieve. It is important
                        for us to remember that when we are designing an app, we are trying to solve real-world problems and not create hicups for the users. 
                        If we pay extra attention to create a cohesive and smooth user experience for the app, then we will truly achieve this goal.
