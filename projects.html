            <p>
                <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
                <div class="content-util--flex flex--content-center">
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--2/3">

                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        We started by picking out the small incoveniences in our daily campus life and ask ourselves which of these incoveniences annoy us the most.
                        Eventually, each of us came up with a few ideas and we grouped them into this mindmap.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        At last, we decided to tackle the "toilet issue" in our campus. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4>Problem scope</h4>
                <div class="content-util--flex flex--gap-small">
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2"><img class="content-util--img-showfull" src="assets/problem_scope.png"></div>
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2"><img class="content-util--img-showfull" src="assets/pov.png"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        Some toilets in the campus always have its cubicles preoccupied, while there are still some vacancies in other toilets,  especially in rush hour.  
                        We find out that a lot of UST students find it inconvenient when you go into toilet and find out all cubicles are occupied. 
                        The toilet facilities in campus are therefore not fully utilised. 

                        <br><br>

                        We discover the situation where students are entering and leaving the washroom within a short period. 
                        This happens especially around 12:00, 13:30, 15:00, which are breaks between lectures. 
                        Some lesser-known washrooms are not utilized as frequently as washrooms near hotspots, eg. Library, LT-A, LG1 canteen…
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2 content-util--img-bg" style="background-image: url('assets/toilet_hotspot.png')"></div>
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2 content-util--img-bg" style="background-image: url('assets/toilet_unoccupied.png')"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        All of us are active users of UST’s washroom. We have all experienced the aforementioned toilet-finding problem. 
                        We all agree that different washrooms were not utilized equally, resulting in some crowding while the others having low usage.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4>Our final solution - a smart toilet system</h4>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2"><img class="content-util--img-showfull" src="assets/mindmap_toilet.png"></div>
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2"><img class="content-util--img-showfull" src="assets/toilet_storyboard.png"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        We think that our campus is in urgent need for a smart toilet system. What do we mean by this? 
                        We will design an app that serves to show all available toilet cubicles directly on your mobile phone.
                        This app may be embedded into the existing HKUST Student / Staff app as a plugin too. With this app,
                        student & staff may now be able to know where is the closest washroom with empty slot. 
                        
                        <br><br>

                        On the technical level, The app will have modern, simplistic and intuitive UI so that it is easy to use. 
                        We will also design the app such that the toilet result's latency time is within seconds so that users
                        get to see the result quickly. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4>My contribution & reflection</h4>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        In my group, I helped to create part of the group presentation ppt by writing ppt text and searching ppt images.
                        I was also responsible for introducing the "Smart Toilet System App" part in our group presentation.

                        <br><br>

                        After this project, I've learnt the importance of thinking from the users' point of view while developing apps.
                        It is always to easy to implement cool and new technologies into an app, but without any consideration and empathy for
                        the app users, the app could become an inconvenience and annoyance regardless of what it could achieve. It is important
                        for us to remember that when we are designing an app, we are trying to solve real-world problems and not create hicups for the users. 
                        If we pay extra attention to create a cohesive and smooth user experience for the app, then we will truly achieve this goal.

            <h3>Project 2: Chatbot for human wellbeing</h3>
            <p>
                <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
                <div class="content-util--flex flex--content-center">
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--2/3">

                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        Our group drafted several storyboards that illustrate scenarios where chatbots can promote user physical, academic and financial wellbeing.
                        After speed dating with some HKUST students, we figured out that a lot of students find managing a healthy lifestyle (i.e. physical wellbeing) to be a challenge.

                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        Finally, we decided to build a health assitant chatbot that focuses on users' physical wellbeing. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4>Problem scope</h4>
                <div class="content-util--flex flex--content-center">
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2"><img class="content-util--img-showfull" src="assets/project2/pov.PNG"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        We started by trying to understand why a health assitant chatbot would be needed. We discover a lot of people are conscious of their health amid their busy lives.
                        They often want to seek health advice and exercise schedule that is catered to their personal need, body type etc.

                        <br><br>

                        These health advices that are personal or specific are often not easy to find on the internet for ordinary users. Although these advices may exist on the
                        internet, most users are often not knowledgeable or professioned enough that they can correctly pick our these advices according to the biological and medical
                        status of their body. Our health bot seeks to address this issue.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4>Prototype - Health assitant chatbot</h4>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2"><img class="content-util--img-showfull" src="assets/project2/prototype_desc.PNG"></div>
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2"><img class="content-util--img-showfull" src="assets/project2/prototype_eg.PNG"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        We designed a prototype chatbot that seeks to help users maintain a healthy lifestyle. Our bot achieves this by helping users to (1) maintain
                        a healthy eating habit and (2) a stable exercise schedule. As for the functions of the bot, it can keep track of the nutrition
                        intake of the users (e.g. how much sugar, sodium the user has consumed) and even suggest healthy eating choices to users according to their intake. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2"><img class="content-util--img-showfull" src="assets/project2/prototype_desc2.PNG"></div>
                    <div class="desktop-or-up--1/2"><img class="content-util--img-showfull" src="assets/project2/prototype_eg2.PNG"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        The bot can also keep track of users' physical activity level so that users know if they've done enough exercise for one week. Since our bot is 
                        designed to resemble a personal assitant, the bot will tend to encourage and motivate users whenever the users are detected to be unmotivated about 
                        doing sports (e.g. when the user tells the bot "I'm feeling lazy. I don't want to do exercise today").

                        <br><br>

                        The bot can also suggest sports for specific fitness training including sports of different types (e.g. weighlifting, stretching), focus muscle group (e.g. biceps, chest) 
                        and difficulty (e.g. beginner, intermediate).

                <div class="content-util--flex">
                    <p>
                        In our group, I helped to program the exercise suggestion function of the prototype bot and add response variety to the bot. I was also responsible
                        for the video demo part of our presentation.

                        <br><br>

                        After this project, I've learnt the importance of focusing on user need as a design motive. Since chatbot is an amusing technolog at first
                        glance, obviously a lot of fancy ideas can be brainstormed through this cool technology. However, if we only make a chatbot without considering
                        user need and usability, then the bot would be possibly of no use and perform even worse when compared to a traditional software. This is why
                        while in this modern time we have so many amazing technologies, such as chatbot, at our hands, it is important to understand that we are utilizing
                        this technology to address the need of users and keep this idea in mind during the design of softwares related to these technologies.
